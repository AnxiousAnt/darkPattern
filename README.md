Title: Multi-Modal Approach for Deceptive Content Detection: NLP and Image Analysis

Abstract:

This research proposes a comprehensive approach to detect deceptive content on websites by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Analysis techniques. The study focuses on two key aspects of deceptive practices: False Urgency and Countdowns.

For False Urgency Detection, a machine learning model is developed utilizing NLP to analyze the text content of websites. The model is trained on labeled data, employing tokenization, feature extraction, and a simple classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes. By identifying patterns associated with false urgency, the model aids in flagging content that induces a sense of artificial urgency.

In the realm of Countdown Detection, an image-based approach is employed. Computer vision techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are utilized to classify images as either containing countdowns or not. The CNN is trained on a diverse dataset comprising images of countdowns and non-countdowns, allowing it to learn and accurately categorize images based on the presence of countdown elements.

By combining both NLP and Image Analysis, this multi-modal approach provides a robust solution for identifying deceptive practices on websites. The synergy between linguistic and visual cues enhances the accuracy and reliability of the overall deception detection system, contributing to a more effective means of safeguarding online users from misleading content.
